# Ai-8-Puzzle-Problem_Using_Informed-and_Uninformed_Search
## Problem Statement.
##### This problem appeared as a project in the edX course ColumbiaX: CSMM.101x Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this assignment an agent will be implemented to solve the 8-puzzle game. An instance of the 8-puzzle game consists of a board holding 8 distinct movable tiles, plus an empty space. For any such board, the empty space may be legally swapped with any tile horizontally or vertically adjacent to it. In this assignment, the blank space is going to be represented with the number 0.
##### Given an initial state of the board, the search problem is to find a sequence of moves that transitions this state to the goal state; that is, the configuration with all tiles arranged in ascending order 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.
##### The search space is the set of all possible states reachable from the initial state. The blank space may be swapped with a component in one of the four directions Up, Down, Left, Right, one move at a time. The cost of moving from one configuration of the board to another is the same and equal to one.
##### Thus, the total cost of path is equal to the number of moves made from the initial state to the goal state.

## Algorithms 
### You will need to implement the 8-puzzle search problem using the three search algorithms:
#### BFS, DFS and A*.

#### For the A* (the informed search) we are going to use Manhattan heuristic and Euclidean heuristic and compare between number of nodes expanded and output paths, and to report which heuristic is more admissible.
##### 1. Manhattan Distance.
##### 2. Euclidean Distance.
